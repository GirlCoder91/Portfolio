                Hi, my name is Anne Lise and I am a UX Designer with a <br>
                passion for design that is accessible for everyone. My <br>
                designs is made by the principle <b> less is more</b> and I make <br>
                designs that are recognisable for the users and have familiar <br> 
                interfaces. <br> 
                <br>
                I have always had a passion for design and also started <br>
                drawing in a early age. I have also learned coding like HTML, <br> 
                CSS and JavaScript and have some experience working as a <br> 
                Frontend Developer that also took care of the design that <br> 
                needed to be coded. <br> 
                <br>
                Some projects I do in my freetime is involving both coding <br> 
                and designing where I am in a process with making my own <br>
                apps and a game. Like others I also enjoy to watch TV series <br>
                and read books.

            Hi, my name is Anne Lise from Norway. I am 32 <br>
            years-old and are living with my parents. I like to <br>
            have a lot to do and learn new things. I always do <br>
            my best regardless of the situation I am in. I am a <br>
            go-getter and working hard to achieve what I <br>
            want is something I always do. <br>
            All my life people around me have looked down <br>
            on me and I am tired of that and are now doing <br>
            my best so that people are going to remember <br>
            me and that what I do is as important as what <br>
            they do.
        </p>

        <p class="whoText">
            <b class="who"> What? </b>
            <br>
            In the introduction I said that I had some <br>
            projects going on and I want here to tell some more <br>
            about them and what else I like to do when not <br>
            working. When I learned how to code a new <br>
            world opened up for me and I saw what I could <br>
            do with the skills I learned. I have 3 different <br>
            projects going on where I am learning new <br>
            coding languages as I go. But besides them I also <br>
            am learning 3D and blowing some dust of my <br>
            drawing skills. I am learning how to draw <br>
            different objects in 3D enviroments like <br>
            Blender. The projects is an app that can help <br>
            with finding out when the mail has come in the <br>
            mailbox, one game where the users can make <br>
            their own furniture from scratch and the last app <br>
            is a nutrition app that will help users finding <br>
            inspiration to different meals during the day, <br>
            where there is option for both brought in shop <br>
            or cooked at home. It also have allergy <br>
            preferences.
